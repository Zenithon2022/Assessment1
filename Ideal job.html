  <h1 style="font-size:40px;background-color:steelblue;">Ideal Job</h1> 
  <p style="font-family: arial"><img src= "Images\Job.jpg" alt="Ideal Job Seek" class="responsive2"> My ideal job is a position with a company called “White Bay Search” in Sydney. The job description is pictured on the right. Alternatively, this is the <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56172757?type=standout#sol=b99f863caed3ab2d0bcf77de864ff322e8e7c376" target="_blank">job advertisement</a> on seek.
  The position is working as a full stack developer alongside a growing ASX-listed business. This particular job is appealing to me as it would utilize my problem solving and project development skills, whilst progressing with the company. The job would allow me to continually develop my programming skills in a competitive environment, as well as delivering quality results for clients.</p>

  <p>The qualifications and experience required for the position include: At least 2 years of being a full stack developer, with backend experience in Microsoft.Net (C#) and Typescript. Frontend experience in ReactJS using Typescript (with JavaScript also a strength). With knowledge in CSS, HTML, .NetCore and .Net5/6 experience being highly valued.  </p>

  <p>My current skills and qualifications are relatively minimal, when compared to the experience required. I have very basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, and I have a little amount of exposure to JavaScript from coding tutorials. From studying introduction to programming, I have also become exposed to some basic Python algorithms. </p>

  <p>I plan on obtaining the skills by starting off in the backend developer route. That would require me to start off learning programming languages such as PHP, C, Python, Ruby and Java. This could be done through paid coding lessons online, or via RMIT. After becoming familiar with backend languages, I would move onto the frontend aspects. This would include strengthening my knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This can easily be done through building a functional website as a project, to display to employers as a platform where I would showcase my experience and skills. These skills can also be learnt through free coding websites online such as freecodecamp.org or through paid options like Codecademy.</p>
